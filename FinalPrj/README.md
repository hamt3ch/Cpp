Meeting 
•	OpenGL is used to draw polygons to the screen
•	Use GLUT utility toolkit 
o	Vertex shader
o	Fragment shader
•	OpenAL is used for audio
•	Read up on matrices because they are important for scaling, translation and rotation
•	Use bounding boxes for collision detection
•	https://www.opengl.org/wiki/Getting_started
•	Worst case scenario we should be able to use libraries that are not on the computers
o	Dynamically link the code and include dll files
